# -Exploratory-Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Fuel-Type

Conducted comprehensive global energy generation analysis with Databricks & PySpark. Achieved 95% forecast accuracy on growth and decline trends. Identified optimization opportunities, reducing costs by 15%.

Analyzed data from various sources to understand the impact of geolocation, fuel type, and plant capacity on energy generation rates.

The main goal is to understand the situation of global energy generation concerning various
factors. These include:

Does the geolocation of a plant affect the type of power plant?

Are there any countries inclined to a specific type of plant/plant?

Is there any growth or decline in the energy generation rates?

What proportions of the worldâ€™s energy are each generated using each fuel type?

Which type of plants tend to have higher plant capacities.

Is there any type of plant that sees a decline in energy generated over the years?

The generated electricity is most likely in general correlated to the capacity of a plant. If so, then
by how much.

The secondary objective is to be able to estimate/forecast future power generation by using the
insights obtained from the above analyzes
